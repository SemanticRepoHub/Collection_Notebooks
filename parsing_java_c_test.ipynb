This involves extracting single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments and associating them with the nearest relevant constructs (e.g., functions, variables).\n","   *In V3, I have added the part of also extracting the code.

with AST & **Documentation**\n","\n","This script extends the parsing functionality of pycparser by integrating a method to extract and associate comments from the original .c source file with code elements like functions, structures, and global variables.\n","\n","**Problem**\n","\n","The core problem is that pycparser does not handle comments within the C source code. As a result, documentation associated with functions, variables, or structures (e.g., comments) is not captured by default. This is crucial for analyzing or documenting the purpose of the code elements.\n","\n","**Solution**\n","\n","The script solves this by:\n","\n","* Extracting Comments: Single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments are captured using regular expressions. The comments are stored along with their respective line numbers for later association.\n","\n","* Matching Comments to Code:\n","Comments are matched to code elements based on proximity, assuming that comments appearing immediately before a code element describe that element. This is done by comparing the line numbers of comments and code elements.\n","\n","* Improved Type Handling:\n","The get_type_name function recursively resolves complex C types (e.g., pointers, arrays) to ensure accurate type representation for parameters, fields, and variables.\n","\n","*Parsing and Linking:\n","The .i file (preprocessed by GCC) is parsed to extract the AST, and the .c file is read to extract comments. These are combined to provide detailed outputs that include documentation for each code element.\n","\n","This approach allows for seamless documentation retrieval without relying on pycparser's internal comment parsing, which it lacks."],"metadata":{"id":"9MpksQT8Eq_W"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","from pycparser import c_ast, parse_file\n","\n","def extract_comments(c_file_path):\n","    \"\"\"Extract comments from the C file.\"\"\"\n","    comments = []\n","    with open(c_file_path, 'r') as file:\n","        lines = file.readlines()\n","        for i, line in enumerate(lines):\n","            #
