# README

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks designed for parsing and analyzing repositories and code snippets in Python, Java, and C using embedding techniques and similarity analysis. These notebooks are ideally run on **Google Colab** to leverage its computational resources.

---

## 1. **PythonSim.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook focuses on Python repositories and code snippet analysis. It employs [**inspect4py**](https://github.com/SemanticRepoHub/inspect4py) repository parsing library, and  **RepoSim4Py** model (pipeline)[1](https://github.com/SemanticRepoHub/RepoSim4py)[2](https://huggingface.co/Henry65/RepoSim4Py) to:

- Genate Python code snippets embeddings and compute their similarity. 
- Parse and extract repository metadata.
- Generate multi-level embeddings (code, documentation, README, and requirements).
- Compute semantic similarity between repositories at different levels.

### Key Features
- Code Snippet similarity
- Extract all the information: functions, imports, classes, methods, code, etc ... from a Python repository
- Uses embeddings to represent repositories at various granularities.
- Computes cosine similarity scores for code, documentation, README, and overall repository content.
- Outputs similarity results in a clear tabular format.

### Ideal Use Case

- Understanding how to generate embeddings from code snippets, and compute their similarity (cosine similarity)
- Understanding how to use inspect4py and extract information
- Analyzing Python repository structures and relationships.
- Performing semantic comparisons of Python codebases.

## 2. **JavaSim.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook extends the analysis framework to Java repositories using a similar embedding approach. It covers:
- Genate Java code snippets embeddings and compute their similarity. Here we are using [Unixcoder DL model](https://huggingface.co/Lazyhope/unixcoder-nine-advtest) (more research is needed).  
- Parsing Java repositories for code and documentation.

### Key Features
- Uses a custom embedding model for Java - more exploration will be needed.
- Understand how to extract code and documentation from Java files

### Ideal Use Case
- Basic semantic analysis of Java snippets. More research is needed to understand what is best model to use - we used Unixcoder just as an example. 
- Identifying relationships between Java projects based on embeddings.

## 3. **parsing_java_c_test.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook demonstrates repository parsing techniques for Java and C projects. It:
- Extracts metadata, dependencies, and code structure.
- Provides basic analysis for repositories written in Java and C.

### Key Features
- Focuses on metadata extraction and structure visualization.
- Demonstrates parsing without in-depth embedding generation.

### Ideal Use Case
- Preprocessing and metadata extraction for Java and C projects.
- Repository structure analysis before applying advanced embedding techniques.

## How to Use
1. Open any of the notebooks in **Google Colab**.
2. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to install required dependencies and run the code.
3. Analyze the results generated by the notebook for insights into repository similarities and code analysis.

---

## Requirements
- **Google Colab** environment - with a google account will be enough to run those. 
- If running locally, Python packages such as `transformers`, `torch`, and other dependencies (automatically installed in each notebook).
- Note that inspect4py needs a Python 3.10 enviroment - this is necessary to do when running the notebooks locally. In google colab not need to create a conda enviroment, they work directly with the provided code.

## Note
These notebooks are designed for demonstration purposes and provide insights into code and repository parsing (using ASTs) analysis (using embeddings).
