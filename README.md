# README

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks designed for analyzing repositories and code snippets in Python, Java, and C/C++ using embedding techniques and similarity analysis. These notebooks are ideally run on **Google Colab** to leverage its computational resources.

---

## 1. **PythonSim.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook focuses on Python repositories and code snippet analysis. It employs the **RepoSim4Py** model to:
- Parse and extract repository metadata.
- Generate multi-level embeddings (code, documentation, README, and requirements).
- Compute semantic similarity between repositories at different levels.

### Key Features
- Uses embeddings to represent repositories at various granularities.
- Computes cosine similarity scores for code, documentation, README, and overall repository content.
- Outputs similarity results in a clear tabular format.

### Ideal Use Case
- Analyzing Python repository structures and relationships.
- Performing semantic comparisons of Python codebases.

## 2. **JavaSim.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook extends the analysis framework to Java repositories using a similar embedding approach. It covers:
- Parsing Java repositories for metadata and structure.
- Generating embeddings for Java code components.
- Comparing semantic similarities across Java repositories.

### Key Features
- Uses a custom embedding model for Java.
- Focuses on multi-level embeddings tailored to Java repositories.
- Outputs similarity results for Java repositories.

### Ideal Use Case
- Semantic analysis of Java repositories.
- Identifying relationships between Java projects based on embeddings.

---

## 3. **parsing_java_c_test.ipynb**
### Description
This notebook demonstrates repository parsing techniques for Java and C/C++ projects. It:
- Extracts metadata, dependencies, and code structure.
- Provides basic analysis for repositories written in Java and C/C++.

### Key Features
- Focuses on metadata extraction and structure visualization.
- Demonstrates parsing without in-depth embedding generation.

### Ideal Use Case
- Preprocessing and metadata extraction for Java and C/C++ projects.
- Repository structure analysis before applying advanced embedding techniques.

---

## How to Use
1. Open any of the notebooks in **Google Colab**.
2. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to install required dependencies and run the code.
3. Analyze the results generated by the notebook for insights into repository similarities and code analysis.

---

## Requirements
- **Google Colab** environment.
- Python packages such as `transformers`, `torch`, and other dependencies (automatically installed in each notebook).

---

## Note
These notebooks are designed for demonstration purposes and provide insights into code and repository analysis using embeddings. For large-scale analysis, additional optimizations may be required.
